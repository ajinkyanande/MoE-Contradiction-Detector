    "Isaac Newton's theory of gravity was based on the idea that all masses attract each other "
    "with a force proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. "
    "His equations successfully described planetary motion and were used for centuries in astronomy. "
    "However, in the early 20th century, Albert Einstein proposed a radically different idea. "
    "According to general relativity, gravity is not a force but rather the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. "
    "Large objects, such as the Sun, bend spacetime, affecting how planets move. "
    "This theory was confirmed when light from distant stars was observed bending around the Sun during a solar eclipse. "
    "Despite its success, general relativity does not fully explain gravity at the quantum level, "
    "leading to the search for a theory of quantum gravity."
)

default_text2 = (
    "Isaac Newton described gravity as a fundamental force acting at a distance, governed by an inverse-square law. "
    "While useful for everyday physics, Newtonian gravity does not accurately describe the behavior of light or extreme conditions such as black holes. "
    "Albert Einstein introduced general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime rather than a force. "
    "Experimental evidence, such as gravitational lensing, has confirmed Einstein's predictions. "
    "However, general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics. "
    "Physicists believe a theory of quantum gravity is necessary to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces. "
    "Some proposed models, such as string theory and loop quantum gravity, aim to bridge this gap."
